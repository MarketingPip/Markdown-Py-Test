# Hello world






## To do 

- [ ] Allow templates to be imported via HTML / Text File with Key Variables.
- [ ] Improve permalinks (add blog posts, category options) 
- [ ] Allow any new pages to be added + change the permalinks
- [ ] Loop through each files 
- [ ] Add regex for matches instead of splitting by character 
- [ ] Blog function (sort blog post by date, add route for tags & categories) 
- [ ] Clean code 


- [ ] Future possibility - add CMS system that can be accesed via Amazon AWS, GitHub API etc or possibily even locally (locally need something thinking but I do believe it is do-able)
